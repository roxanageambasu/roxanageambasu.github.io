title: Teaching and Advising
---
I teach the core distributed systems curriculum at Columbia and am in the
process of developing a privacy curriculum.  I publish most of my teaching
materials online:

* [Distributed Systems Fundamentals](https://columbia.github.io/ds1-class/),
  undergraduate-level course. (Since 2012)
* [Advanced Distributed Systems](https://columbia.github.io/ds2-class/),
  graduate-level research seminar. (Since 2015)
* [Private Systems](https://columbia.github.io/private-systems-class/),
  graduate-level research seminnar. (New in 2020)

## M.S. and Undergraduate Advising

I serve as an M.S. and undergraduate advisor.
I hold office hours on Thursdays 10am-11:30am.
Please come to the office hours instead of writing emails with questions.  Only
if the OH cannot work please email me.
For undergraduates, Prof. Nakul Verma has a very good [FAQ](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~verma/advising.html)
covering what courses are admissible for different tracks and other related topics.  Being new to
undergraduate advising, I myself often refer to his FAQ.  So I encourage
students to first consult this FAQ if they want to clarify some things, as you
might get a faster response to basic questions and may help you make decisions
that are then easier for me to approve, if approval is needed.
