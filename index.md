title: Overview
---

I am an associate professor of Computer Science at Columbia University. My research spans broad areas of computer systems,
including distributed systems, security and privacy, operating systems, databases, and applications of cryptography and machine
learning to systems.
Much of my current research aims to expose problems and invent solutions to threats to our data security and privacy in the context of new, emerging technologies, such as cloud computing, mobile devices, and big data.
I design, build, and evaluate scalable distributed infrastructures that address these problems.

### Short Bio

I joined Columbia in Fall 2011 after finishing my Ph.D. in Computer Science
(CS) at the University of Washington.
I did my undergraduate in my home country, Romania, at the Polytechnic
University of Bucharest, also majoring in CS.
I am now part of the [Columbia Software Systems Lab](http://systems.cs.columbia.edu/),
an energetic group of professors and students working on highly relevant challenges in
today's cutting-edge technologies, such as mobile devices, cloud computing, and
distributed systems.

For my research in cloud and mobile data privacy, I received 
an Alfred P. Sloan Faculty Fellowship, a Microsoft Research Faculty Fellowship,
an NSF CAREER award,  a ''Brilliant 10'' Popular Science nomination, an Early
Career Award in Cybersecurity from the University of Washington Center for
Academic Excellence, the Honorable Mention for the 2013 inaugural Dennis M. Ritchie
Doctoral Dissertation Award, a William Chan Dissertation Award, two
best paper awards at top systems conferences, and the first Google
Ph.D. Fellowship in Cloud Computing.


### Recruiting

**I am looking for new Ph.D. students, as well as Columbia project students.**
If you are a highly motivated person, you have solid coding experience
(particularly systems building experience), and you are interested in
doing distributed systems research, please email me your resume and
tell me about your research interests.

I am **not** looking for interns or other short-term visitors.
So please do not contact me about such opportunities, unless I have
explicitly contacted you, your advisor, or your school.
